ðŸ“Š Analysis of Bikes Sales Dataset Using Excel
ðŸŸ£ Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a Bikes Sales dataset to uncover key patterns and relationships in customer purchasing behavior. The dataset contains demographic information about the buyers, including:
â€¢	Income range
â€¢	Number of children
â€¢	Occupation
â€¢	Commute distance
â€¢	Region
â€¢	Age
Using Microsoft Excel's powerful analytical tools, we cleaned, transformed, and visualized the data to produce actionable insight into the factors influencing bike purchases.

ðŸŸ£ Data Cleaning and Transformation
To prepare the data for analysis, the following steps were taken:
âœ… Removed duplicates: Ensuring all transactions were unique.
âœ… Removed unnecessary columns: Columns that were not relevant to the analysis were discarded.
âœ… Nested IF Statements: Age brackets were classified into 3 groups:
â€¢	Adolescent
â€¢	Middle-aged
â€¢	Old

ðŸŸ£ Analysis Performed
Using PivotTable, Nested IF, and Chart features in Excel, we performed the following analyses:
âœ… Average Income by Gender of Buyers:
â€¢	A PivotTable was created to show the average income of bike purchasers by gender.
âœ… Visualization:
â€¢	A bar chart was created to visualize average income per gender.
â€¢	The bar chart includes a data table to show raw values alongside the graphical representation.
âœ… Relationship Between Commute Distance and Number of Purchases:
â€¢	A PivotTable was constructed to show how commute distance correlates with the number of purchases.
â€¢	A line graph was used to visualize this relationship.
âœ… Relationship Between Age Bracket and Number of Purchases:
â€¢	Another PivotTable was created to show the distribution of purchases across age brackets.
â€¢	A line graph was generated to visualize this pattern.

ðŸŸ£ Summary of Tools and Techniques
âœ… Microsoft Excel Tools:
â€¢	PivotTable
â€¢	Bar and Line Charts
â€¢	IF Statements (Nested IF)
â€¢	Removal of duplicates and unnecessary columns
âœ… Analysis Techniques:
â€¢	Descriptive statistics (average)
â€¢	Categorical grouping (age brackets)
â€¢	Data visualization to aid interpretability

ðŸŸ£ Conclusion
This analysis highlights:
â€¢	The average income of bike purchasers varies by gender.
â€¢	There is a clear relationship between commute distance and likelihood of buying a bike.
â€¢	Age brackets show different purchasing patterns, reflecting lifestyle and financial factors.
