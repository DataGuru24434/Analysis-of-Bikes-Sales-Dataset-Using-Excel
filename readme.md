# ðŸ“Š Analysis of Bike Sales Dataset Using Excel  

## ðŸŸ£ Project Overview  
This project analyzes a **Bike Sales dataset** to uncover key patterns and relationships in customer purchasing behavior. The dataset includes demographic details such as:  

- Income range  
- Number of children  
- Occupation  
- Commute distance  
- Region  
- Age  

Using **Microsoft Excel**, the data was cleaned, transformed, and visualized to generate actionable insights into the factors influencing bike purchases.

## ðŸŸ£ Data Cleaning and Transformation  
To prepare the dataset for analysis, the following steps were taken:  

- âœ… **Removed duplicates** â€“ ensured all transactions were unique.  
- âœ… **Removed unnecessary columns** â€“ excluded irrelevant fields.  
- âœ… **Created Age Brackets** using Nested IF statements:  
  - Adolescent  
  - Middle-aged  
  - Old

## ðŸŸ£ Analysis Performed  

### 1. Average Income by Gender  
- A PivotTable was used to calculate the average income of bike purchasers by gender.  
- A bar chart (with data table) was created to visualize the comparison.  

### 2. Commute Distance vs Number of Purchases  
- A PivotTable showed the relationship between commute distance and purchase frequency.  
- A line graph visualized this relationship.  

### 3. Age Bracket vs Number of Purchases  
- A PivotTable was used to analyze how purchases were distributed across age brackets.  
- A line graph was generated to illustrate these trends.
